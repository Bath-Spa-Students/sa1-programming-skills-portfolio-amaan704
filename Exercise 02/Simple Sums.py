"""In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arith-
metic operations, and print the result to the console.

Steps:
1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value 8.
2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value 10.
3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
4. Print the value of the sum to the console."""

#Creating and working with integer variables, perform arithmetic operations, and printing the result

#Step 1
#Assigning the integer value 8 to the variable int1
int1 = 8

#Step 2
#Assigning the integer value 10 to the variable int2
int2 = 10

#Step 3
#Adding int1 and int2 together in a variable
sum_of_integers = int1 +int2

#printing the sum
print(sum_of_integers)
